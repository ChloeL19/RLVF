I think the error message is not very clear so let's try to understand what vernac is.\nvernac is a programming language developed by Microsoft in the mid-2000s, which is named after the name of the first and only computer that it was originally designed for (the original name was Visual Basic for the Learning Environment). It was a high-level imperative programming language with some visual-appearance-like semantics, with data structures like arrays and strings. vernac can be used to write compiler-competent programs which can be compiled into some form of assembly language. The use of vernac is now primarily limited to the MSDN documentation and online forums.\n\nIf you read the documentation and forums for vernac, the reason why this error occurs could be related to the syntax of the language itself.
